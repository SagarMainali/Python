Introduction:

This project is based on designing and implementing a system for
the Inland Revenue Department of Nepal government that tracks the income taxes. The code
written serves every required function. The code is totally based on functional programming
and every function is called in the main() function at the end. However the code is not based on
class and object method because of not total understanding of the concept of class and objects.
But the code is well written and provided with comments that explain many lines.
The list has been used to store the customer info. The condition to talk about is the condition of
disability and diplomat. Here, the program doesn’t intend to ask the user diplomat information
if the user inputs ‘y’(yes) when asked about disability in the beginning. If the user is not disabled
the program then asks about the diplomat information and if s/he is a diplomat then asks
information about the foreign allowance. The first step is to display the static information and
then ask for the number of customers and their information afterwards. As said, every single
information is recorded in related lists. ‘For loop’ has been used to take the information in case
of more than one customer. The information taken from the user is then calculated using the
user-defined-function and then displayed in the console along with the static information. At
the end the same information is also recorded in files named taxinfo.txt.
